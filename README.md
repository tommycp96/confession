[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/27ff9881-47df-4b98-a368-909516e993b5/deploy-status?branch=main)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/tommyconfession/deploys)

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for a special project that played a pivotal role in my personal lifeâ€”confessing my feelings to the woman who would eventually become my wife. In a world where flowers and chocolates still reign supreme, I decided to break the mold by coding my confession instead. Originally housed at `https://github.com/whenTCmeetsEC/whenTCmeetsEC.github.io`, this project was migrated here five years ago. At that time, edge delivery deployment platforms like Netlify had not yet matured to offer direct deployment pipelines. This simple web application was crafted with love and hosted on Netlify, proving that even in romance, sometimes the best way to someone's heart is through a server!

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to create a digital space where I could share my feelings openly and creatively. It served as a platform to confess my love in a manner that was both meaningful and intimate.

## Technology Stack

This project was developed using basic and simple web tech stack:

- HTML: For structuring the web content.
- CSS: For styling the application to make it visually appealing.
- JavaScript: For adding interactive elements to enhance the user experience.

## Deployment

The application is deployed on Netlify, allowing it to be accessible from anywhere at any time. You can visit the live application [tommyconfession.netlify.app](https://tommyconfession.netlify.app/).

## How to Use

To view the confession:

1. Visit the Netlify URL provided above.
2. Experience the site as it was originally intended, with a simple interface guiding you through the confession.

## Project Status

This project was a personal endeavor and is currently in a static state. It is kept online as a testament and memory of the beginnings of a lifelong journey together.
